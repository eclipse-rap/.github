# Eclipse Remote Application Platform™ (RAP)

The [Eclipse Remote Application Platform™ (RAP)](https://www.eclipse.org/rap/) is a framework for modular business applications that can be accessed from multiple client types, including web browsers, rich clients and mobile devices. It provides a powerful cross-platform widget toolkit based on the proven SWT API that enables developers to write applications entirely in Java and reuse the same code across multiple platforms.

Regardless of the client platform, RAP applications run on a server that communicates with its clients via HTTP. The applications can therefore be deployed on any servlet container. With the RAP OSGi integration, they can be composed of modules and communicate via the OSGi service model.
